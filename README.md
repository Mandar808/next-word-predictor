Next-Word Predictor
Overview
The Next-Word Predictor is a neural network-based model designed to generate the next word in a given text sequence. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for tokenization and sequence prediction. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and NLTK to enhance text generation capabilities.

Features
Predicts the next word based on the given input text.

Uses NLTK for tokenization and preprocessing.

Model trained using TensorFlow for sequence prediction.

Simple and interactive user interface using Streamlit.

Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/next-word-predictor.git  
cd next-word-predictor  
Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Usage
Run the application locally using Streamlit:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py  
How to Use
Open the Streamlit app after running the above command.

Enter a partial sentence in the input box.

The model will predict and display the most probable next word.

Future Enhancements
Improve prediction accuracy using a larger dataset.

Optimize the model using LSTM or Transformer-based architectures.

Enhance the UI with additional interactive elements.

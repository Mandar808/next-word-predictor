# **Next-Word Predictor**  

## **Overview**  
The **Next-Word Predictor** is a neural network-based model designed to generate the next word in a given text sequence. It utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for tokenization and sequence prediction. The project is implemented using **TensorFlow** and **NLTK** to enhance text generation capabilities.  

## **Features**  
- Predicts the next word based on the given input text.  
- Uses **NLTK** for tokenization and preprocessing.  
- Model trained using **TensorFlow** for sequence prediction.  
- Simple and interactive user interface using **Streamlit**.  

## **Installation**  
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/next-word-predictor.git  
cd next-word-predictor
